# My User/Shell Configuration

**Focus:** ZSH (+oh-my-zsh), Git, Vim/MacVim

A few notes:

1. Make sure to **edit .gitconfig** to your needs/liking (name, email, github, etc)
2. Don't expect perfection. It is and it will always be a *work in progress*.
3. *oh-my-zsh* freaking ROCKS!
4. I used submodules for both oh-my-zsh and my .vim configuration. Feel free to check their original repos.
5. A lot of this stuff has been collected over time from many configurations. I only mention the sources when I felt it was something more "creative" as most of it is just plain "config talk" available via 'man' or something. If you feel I should've referenced you/your conf, please contact me.
6. Feel free to use it, fork it, whatever.
