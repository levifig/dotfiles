# My User/Shell Configuration

Focus: ZSH (+oh-my-zsh), Git, Vim/MacVim

A few notes:
1. Make sure to edit .gitconfig to your needs/liking (name, email, github, etc)
2. Don't expect perfection. It is and it will always be a work in progress.
3. oh-my-zsh freaking ROCKS!
4. I used submodules for both oh-my-zsh and my .vim configuration. You can click on them to view the original repos.
5. A lot of this stuff has been collected from other configurations. I only mentioned the sources when it was something more creativity as most of it is just plain "config talk", available via 'man' or something.
6. Feel free to use it, fork it, whatever.
