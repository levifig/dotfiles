# My User/Shell Configuration

**Focus:** ZSH (+oh-my-zsh), Git, Vim/MacVim

A few notes:

- I'm still missing an installer. I'll get on it soon. You'll have to manually link the files here to your home dir. I recommend cloning this repo to a .dotfiles dir in your home folder and symlinking it from there.
- Make sure to **edit gitconfig** to your needs/liking (name, email, github, etc)
- Don't expect perfection. It is and it will always be a *work in progress*.
- *oh-my-zsh* freaking ROCKS!
- I used submodules for both oh-my-zsh and my .vim configuration. Feel free to check their original repos.
- A lot of this stuff has been collected over time from many configurations. I only mention the sources when I felt it was something more "creative" as most of it is just plain "config talk" available via 'man' or something. If you feel I should've referenced you/your conf, please contact me.
- Feel free to use it, fork it, whatever.
