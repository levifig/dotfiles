# My User/Shell Configuration

**Focus:** ZSH (+oh-my-zsh), Git, Vim/MacVim

A few notes:

- I'm still missing an installer. I recommend cloning this repo to a .dotfiles dir in your home folder and symlinking it from there.
- Make sure to **edit gitconfig** to your needs/liking (name, email, github, etc)
- Don't expect perfection. This is (and will always be) a *work in progress*.
- [*Oh-My-ZSH*](http://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) ROCKS!
- I used submodules as much as I could for both Oh-My-ZSH and Vim plugins. Make use of themâ€¦
- A lot of this stuff has been collected over time from many sources. I only mention the sources when I felt it was something more "creative" as most of it is just plain "config talk" available via 'man' or something. If you feel I should've referenced you/your conf, please contact me.
- Fork it away. Submit bug fixes and suggestions.
- Enjoy. :)
