# ZSH Configuration

## Recent Changes

### AWS CLI Completions
- Added AWS CLI bash-style completions after mise activation
- Configured alongside Terraform completions in the bash-style completion section

### PATH Configuration
- Made PATH export more readable by putting each path on its own line using backslash continuation

### Completion Optimization
- Created `_cache_completions()` batch function to handle multiple completions efficiently
- Replaced individual `_cache_or_eval` calls with single batch call
- Moved Docker completions to cached format using `docker completion zsh`
- Optimized Homebrew zsh-completions setup by caching `brew --prefix` result

### File Structure Cleanup
- Consolidated aliases and functions loading into single nested loop
- Renamed `_cache_completions_batch` to `_cache_completions` for cleaner naming
- Unified history file location for all shell types in `.zshenv`

### Configuration File Organization
- Moved from symlink approach to minimal `.zshrc` file that sources main `zshrc`
- Updated `.zshenv` to handle proper shell startup sequence

### Minor Fixes
- Removed empty line after "Current time:" output before prompt
- Eliminated duplicate mise completion loading
- Cleaned up boot time display formatting
